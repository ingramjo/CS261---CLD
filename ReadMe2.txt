For this problem, you will implement the Deque ADT with a CircularlyDoublyLinked
List with a Sentinel. As you know, the sentinel is a special link, does not contain a meaningful value, and should not be removed.
Using a sentinel makes some linked list operations easier and cleaner in implementation. This list is circular,
meaning the end points back to the beginning, thus one sentinel suffices. Implement all functions with the
// FIXME... comments in circularList.c .
